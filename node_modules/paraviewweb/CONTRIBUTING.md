## Testing Changes

Testing changes to UI components is done by running the documentation and examples locally
and viewing the results.  To build and run the documentation/examples run the following:

    $ npm run doc:www

Then open a web browser to http://localhost:4000/paraviewweb to view 
the documentation and examples based on the locally modified paraviewweb.

## Updating Documentation

The ParaViewWeb documentation is part of the code repository.
